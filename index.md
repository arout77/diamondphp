DIAMONDPHP
=============
Diamond PHP is a fully featured web development framework built for PHP 7 and offers extreme performance, a modular architecture, elegant syntax and an easy to use philosophy.

### PROJECT STATUS
Diamond PHP is currently in **ALPHA** stages of development. As such, it is not recommended to use the framework in a production environment yet.
A beta version is scheduled for on December 1, 2016, and a production-ready version 1.0.0 is scheduled for public release on January 15, 2017.

### PHILOSOPHY & GOALS
Like all frameworks, Diamond PHP strives to simplify and speed up the web development process. Where Diamond PHP deviates from most frameworks
is in its emphasis on the *developer*, by creating an extraordinarily easy to learn and easy to use environment -- without sacrificing performance,
features or extensibility. A framework should help a developer by completing common tasks for the developer and providing options for other tasks,
but still being perfectly capable of "getting out of the way" when needed. A framework cannot be all things to all people, so it is important to be
able to *safely* work outside the box with minimal fuss when needed.
We think that you'll find the blazing fast performance, the ultra-light footprint, the comprehensive feature set and the emphasis on ease of use 
to be an indispensable new tool in your web development repertoire.

### Installation
1. Create an empty database. Using a tool of your choice (phpMyAdmin, SSH, etc), import the diamondphp.sql file located in the **/var/install** folder.

2. Open the configuration file: /app/code/core/config/Config.php
3. Enter your database connection settings on lines 15-18
4. Enter your site or business name on line 26     `( $this->setting['site_name'] = '' )`
5.  Enter your site admin / customer care email address on line 32 `( $this->setting['site_email'] = ''  )`

That's it! If you are installing the framework into a subdirectory, you'll have one more step to complete:

##### IF YOU ARE INSTALLING IN A SUBDIRECTORY
Find the following line in Config.php, on or near line 185:

    $this->setting['site_url'] = $protocol . $_SERVER["SERVER_NAME"] . '/' . $uri[0][0];

Change the `$uri[0][0]` array to `$uri[0][1]` and then append a forward slash. Example:

    $this->setting['site_url'] = $protocol . $_SERVER["SERVER_NAME"] . '/' . $uri[0][1] . '/';

To complete installation in subdirectory, you will need to also update the RewriteBase rule in the provided .htaccess file in the root directory.  Change `RewriteBase /` to `RewriteBase /name-of-your-subdirectory/`


The remaining settings are optional to complete, but is highly recommended to go through them and add/edit as necessary.
